# Reference Examples

This directory contains example implementations of the design-to-code rules. These files serve as a reference for:

- **Component Structure**: `components/shell`, `components/steps`, `components/ui`
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first patterns using `clamp()` and max-width constraints.
- **State Management**: Context and hooks for flow navigation.
- **Animations**: Framer Motion variants.

## Usage

Use these examples to understand the project patterns. When implementing your own features, create new components in `src/components`, `src/pages`, etc., following these patterns but adapting them to your specific requirements.

## Directory Structure

- `components/`: UI building blocks.
- `contexts/`: React Context state.
- `hooks/`: Custom hooks.
- `pages/`: Page compositions.
- `utils/`: Helper functions.
